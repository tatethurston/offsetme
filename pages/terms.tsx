        Terms of Service

      <p>Last updated: March 8, 2022</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you
        and Offsetme. (“Offsetme,” “we” and “us”). These Terms govern your use
        of the Offsetme website(s), products, services and applications that may
        be available from time to time (the “Services”). You must agree to and
        accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the
        Services. Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to
        all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use
        the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as
        well as those in our Privacy Policy, which are incorporated into these
        Terms by reference.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you have any questions, comments or concerns about these Terms or the
        Services, please contact us at{" "}

        Modification
      </Heading>
      <p>
        We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may
        need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change
        the Terms at any time. If the changes materially impact the Terms, we
        will use reasonable efforts to bring it to your attention by placing a
        notice on the Offsetme website, by sending you an email, and/or by some
        other means.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them;
        unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the
        Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms
        is effective, that means you agree to be bound by all of the changes.

        Offsetme’s Services allow you and your customers to find, compare,
        select and purchase negative emissions, renewable energy credits, and
        carbon offset credits (“Credits”). You may use the Services to purchase
        Credits from third-party negative emissions and carbon offset developers
        or registries (“Supply Partner”) and Offsetme will provide you with the
        appropriate evidence of your purchase of Credits. Offsetme serves as an
        intermediary between you and the applicable Supply Partner.
